## About This Game

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my first web app, based on the game from the Pokémon anime. This project was developed in an effort to practice what I've learned regarding JavaScript and jQuery, and is fully open-source. I am updating this game frequently to include bug fixes and new Pokémon, so check back often for a fresh experience!

For quicker access, add this game to your device's home screen!

## How To Play

Are you a Pokémon Master? Put your knowledge to the test, and see if you can correctly identify a series of 20 Pokémon.

Upon starting the game, you'll be presented with the game board, which contains the following features:

1. *Counter* - Shows you the current number in the series, and how many Pokémon are remaining for you to identify.
2. *Hint Button* - Click or tap this button to view a hint box containing the Pokémon's Pokédex entry.
3. *Skip Button* - If you're having a hard time identifying a Pokémon, you can click or tap this button to skip it, but be warned that you'll miss out on valuable points!
4. *Current Pokémon* - The silhouette of the current Pokémon. Can you identify it correctly?
5. *Entry Box* - Enter your guesses into this box.

After you've been through all 20 Pokémon, you'll see your score (calcuated as a percentage), as well as buttons that can be used to share your score to Twitter or Facebook. Feel free to play through the game as many times as you'd like to get the best score possible!
